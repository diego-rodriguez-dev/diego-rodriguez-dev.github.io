When a new AWS account is created, a default VPC is preconfigured in each Region.
This VPC provides a very basic network environment that allows new users to deploy
AWS Services is a very efficient way. Nevertheless, this setup is very limited
and most applications might have specific network and security requirements
that might not be fulfilled by the default VPC.

During this blog, **we'll discuss how to set up a more secure and scalable VPC,
capable of handling a wider range of security and network related requirements.**
This infrastructure will be generated using a reusable terraform module
to ensure consistency across the system.

## Prerequisites

- An active AWS account to deploy the infrastructure.
- Terraform v1.10.1 or higher.
- AWS CLI v2.22.3 or higher.

## VPC Architecture

The VPC will consist of the following components:

- 1 Virtual Private Cloud created in the eu-central-1 region.
- 2 Public Subnets in the eu-central-1a and eu-central-1b availability zones.
- 2 Private Subnets in the eu-central-1a and eu-central-1b availability zones.
- 1 Internet Gateway routed to the public subnets
- 2 Nat Gateways (1 in each availability zones) to provide internet access
from the Private Subnets
