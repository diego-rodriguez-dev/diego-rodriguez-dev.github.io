Hi, I'm Diego Rodriguez and welcome to my personal portfolio!

I currently work as Senior Software Architect,
but I started my career as a Project Engineer in area of Simulation and
over time my curiosity lead me to branch out to other areas of Software Development
like Frontend/Backend Development, CI/CD and Cloud Engineering.

I have been living in Germany for over 10 years, but I am originally
from the small country of El Salvador.
