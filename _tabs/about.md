Hi, I'm Diego Rodriguez and welcome to my personal portfolio!

I'm a Senior Software Architect with 5+ years of experience in designing cloud-native solutions, developing scalable
applications, and optimizing IT infrastructure using AWS and modern frameworks. Skilled in leading cross-functional
teams while mentoring developers, and aligning technical strategies with business goals.

I have been living in Germany for over 12 years, but I am originally
from the small country of El Salvador.

Feel free to explore my [resume](/posts/resume) or the rest of my portfolio and
connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-rodriguez-4a6ab61a6/).
I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations,
so don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to work together or discuss a project.
Let’s build something amazing together!
